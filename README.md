# Cyhermes Assesssment (Static Web Page)

I implemented a static web page with React, as well as styling with SASS. The Design specification can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmUmROjEXqBxtGUuoaeKGyzLxJy3?e=S89dig). Since this is a static web page, I specifically used large screen size (1420px x 567px). The webpage may not render well when accessed on mobile or tablet screen sizes, as it is not responsive.

## Built with

- React (Create React App)
- SASS (Node Sass)
- ESlint / Stylelint (Linters)
- Git/GitHub
- [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cf702438-b775-4cce-acca-43377530f78c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cyhermes/deploys)
